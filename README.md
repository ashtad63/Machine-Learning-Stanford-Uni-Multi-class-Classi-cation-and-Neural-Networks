# Machine Learning (Coursera): Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

For this exercise, you will use logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten 
digits (from 0 to 9).
1. In the first part of the exercise, you will extend your previous implemention of logistic regression 
and apply it to one-vs-all classication.
2. In the second part of the exercise, you will implement a neural network to recognize handwritten 
digits using the same training set as before. The neural network will be able to represent complex models 
that form non-linear hypotheses.
